* TODO List

    Don't create buttons in combat.  Full check-through for what does and
    doesn't need InCombatLockdown() checks.  May have to create the
    ItemButtons in the XML.

    Put a background on the slots.

    Put the blank spots at the top, not the bottom, so that dragging
    bigger bags in rearranges things the least.

    Attach or implement the BackpackTokenFrame (and remove the mouseover).
        - OptionalDeps: Blizzard_TokenUI
        - Need a ThinGreenEdgeTemplate
        - Where to put it is a problem based on the size of the frames.
        - 3 frames inheriting BackpackTokenTemplate with id=currencyID
        - Each one is 50x12 in size.
        - Override BackpackTokenFrame_Update as there is no event for this
          and that is called by the Token Frame.
        - Don't attack it to non-backpack.

    Search filter the bag buttons.

    Check if the search box is working right when switching focus between
    the bag and bank one.

    Attach the bag buttons somewhere sensible.  Make the proper number of
    them for the bank.

    What to do with the specialist bag types?

    Is there a use for indication of "non-useable" items a-la Combuctor?

    Redo the logic for the bag button colors/texture/tooltips, it is a mess.

    Why is part of Skada showing through the background on first show?  Is it
    my bug or theirs? Don't really want to use HIGH frame strata.

    Make the frames resizeable (maybe?).

    Make the backpack frame moveable (maybe?).  If so it would have to dock
    back into place if dragged towards the bottom right.

    Make the bank frame default to 14 wide (since the default bank bag is 28).
